PHOTO PRIVACY SYSTEM - SIMPLE USER GUIDE
=======================================

Dear User,

Thank you for choosing the Photo Privacy System! This guide will help you get started with protecting your photos using our easy-to-use application. We've designed this system to be simple and straightforward, even if you're not familiar with technical computer concepts.

WHAT IS THE PHOTO PRIVACY SYSTEM?
--------------------------------
The Photo Privacy System is a special application that helps you protect your photos in two ways:

1. Face Recognition: Only you can access your private photos by showing your face to the camera
2. Hidden Messages: You can add secret text messages inside your photos that only you can see

Think of it as a digital photo album with a face-recognition lock and the ability to hide secret notes inside your pictures!
